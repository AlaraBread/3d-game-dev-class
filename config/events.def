The solar processors convert that radiation into High-energy Dense Gluon fuel.  This fuel is used in our reactor core to power the station.  HDGs are also the key fuel for interstellar travel.  Vast ammounts are needed to enter FTL travel through 4th Dimensional Space.  Not only does the station need it to function, we can earn revenues when ships dock at our ports in need of refueling.",
